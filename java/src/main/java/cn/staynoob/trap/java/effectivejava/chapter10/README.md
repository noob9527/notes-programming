## Chapter10: Concurrency

### Synchronize access to shared mutable data
In summary, when multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform synchronization. Without synchronization, there is no guarantee that one thread's changes will be visible to another. The penalties for failing to synchronize shared mutable data are liveness and safety failures. These failures are among the most difficult to debug. They can be intermittent and timing-dependent, and program behavior can vary radically from one VM to another. If you need only inter-thread communication, and not mutual exclusion, the volatile modifier is an acceptable form of synchronization, but it can be tricky to use correctly.
